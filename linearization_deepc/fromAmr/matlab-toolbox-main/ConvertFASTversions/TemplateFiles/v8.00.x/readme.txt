variables still to be removed:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ADAMS columns in Tower and Blade files removed (keep code for now)
AeroCent column in blade file removed... look for repurcussions... should be in AeroDyn

---------------------- TIP-BRAKE -----------------------------------------------
   0.0      TBDrConN    - Tip-brake drag constant during normal operation, Cd*Area (m^2)
   0.0      TBDrConD    - Tip-brake drag constant during fully-deployed operation, Cd*Area (m^2)
   0.0      TpBrDT      - Time for tip-brake to reach full deployment once released (sec)

9999.9      TTpBrDp(1)  - Time to initiate deployment of tip brake 1 (s)
9999.9      TTpBrDp(2)  - Time to initiate deployment of tip brake 2 (s)
9999.9      TTpBrDp(3)  - Time to initiate deployment of tip brake 3 (s) [unused for 2 blades]

tip-brake aerodynamics: let's not support it in this version
furling: let's not support it in this version
adams: let's not support it in this version


controls:
add simple yaw control: fixed yaw with this variable:
   0.0      YawNeut     - Neutral yaw position--yaw spring force is zero at this yaw (degrees)  <--- RENAME THIS VARIABLE



ed: Outputs that are invalid now:
      ! RotCq  -> uses airdensity
      ! RotCp  -> uses airdensity
      ! RotCt  -> uses airdensity
      ! HSShftCq -> uses airdensity
      ! HSShftCp -> uses airdensity
      ! GenCq -> uses airdensity
      ! GenCp -> uses airdensity

      ! NacYawErr -> only computed with CompAero.... is this a SrvD output now?
